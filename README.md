 # The Written Analysis of the results
 ## Overview of the project: 
Louise's play Fever came close to reaching its fundraising target. She now wants to know how other campaigns fared in terms of their debut dates and financing targets. In this anaylsis I have visualize the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The purpose of the analysis is to find out the success, canceled and failed outcomes of threatre plays based on their launch rate and on their funding goal data. 

## Analysis and Challenges: 
I performed the anaylsis by making sure I am getting the correct outcomes and goals and results. I made sure that if I am not getting anything right then I try again again with different formula's and prespective to get the correct anaylisis. 

###### Challenges: 

The challenegs I faced was getting correct formula's on excel sheet. A small mistakes in the formula's does not gave me the answer. So I have to try agan and again to get the relevant answer to the anaylisis. The biggest challenge was making sure getting the correct data and results from the Analysis. 

## Results: 

###### Conclusions on Theater Outcomes by Launch Date : 

The two conclusions that are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the success rate is higher for the plays which were launched on April May and june. And the Failed rate is lower than success rate but there are many plays that were failed in september and October. The below chart explains the sucess and failure of the plays.

###### Outcomes based on Goals: 

The successful plays were between 1000 to 4999. The highest percentage successful was 76%. If you can view the chart below, there is pattern between successful or failed. But for the canceled percentage there is flat line around 0%. That means there were no plays that were canceled. Plays were either successful or failed.

## Limitations: 

The Limitations of the data set was it was really big to anaylze, there were so many things that needed to be worked on get the results of. 

## Recomendations: 

The other possible tables or graphs that we could create was of filtering the countries and getting their percentage for successful and failed plays. We only focused on US and GB. there were other countries to where we can focus and get the results for the anaylsis.
